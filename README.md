I built this over the course of a couple of days while in China.

Could we take the great user interface of Slack and make something that is just for files?

Future plans were to add versioning, discussion functionality, etc.

We (Kingma and I) canned the idea because we weren't really into file sharing for teams and it seemed like a bit of a non-issue.
